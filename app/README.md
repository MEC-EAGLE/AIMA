# AI Opportunities Web App

This is a minimalist React application built with Vite **4.1.0** and TypeScript. The UI uses Bootstrap for styling. It aims to provide a skeleton implementation of a platform where organizations can post AI opportunities and community members can interact with them.

## Features

- **Registration and Login** pages with email and phone fields
- **Dashboard** with a search bar for opportunities
- **Create Opportunity** page (organizations only)
- **Community** page placeholder
- Basic navigation using React Router

## Development

Node modules are not included in this repository. To run or build the project locally, ensure that you have Node.js installed and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will start Vite on port 3000.

## Disclaimer

The current implementation is a frontâ€‘end prototype only. It lacks backend integration for features such as email/phone verification, data persistence, or authentication. These would need to be implemented separately.
