# AI Community Portal

This is a minimal Flask-based web app skeleton that demonstrates a subset of the requested features for an AI-focused community platform.

## Features

- User registration and login
- Dashboard page for logged-in users
- Basic job listing functionality
- Additional pages for internships, volunteering, projects, community, and groups
- Apply to jobs directly on the site
- Join community groups
- View personal application history
- Simple job search
- SQLite database via SQLAlchemy

## Setup

1. Create a Python virtual environment (optional).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r webapp/requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python webapp/app.py
   ```

This is just a proof-of-concept. Many features from the full specification are not implemented.
